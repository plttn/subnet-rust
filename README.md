# Subnet Calculator Rust

This is a reimplementation of [Subnet Calc](https://github.com/plttn/subnet-calc)
so that I can learn Rust.

## For Students

Given that Rust is a lot less popular in education, I'm not *as* worried about
this as I was with my C++ version, but please don't use this for a class.
